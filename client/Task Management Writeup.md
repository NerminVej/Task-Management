This is a step by step documentation on how I implemented this Project.

# Step 1: Design a registration page that includes input fields for name, email, and password:
    
1. Create a user interface (UI) with input fields for users to enter their name, email, and password.
    - Use appropriate form validation to ensure the entered information is valid and meets the necessary criteria (e.g., password strength requirements).
    - Consider adding additional fields if needed, such as a confirmation password field or a checkbox for terms and conditions.
2. Add a "Sign Up" button to initiate the registration process:
    
    - Implement a button that triggers the registration process when clicked.
    - Validate the input data on the server-side to ensure it is valid and not already registered.
    - Store the user information securely in the database, hashing and salting the password for security.

# Step 2: Task Creation:

1. Create a form with fields for title, description, due date, and priority:
    
    - Design a UI form with input fields for the task title, description, due date, and priority level (e.g., high, medium, low).
    - Implement appropriate validation for the fields, such as checking for required fields and validating the due date format.
2. Include a "Create Task" button to save the task details:
    
    - Add a button that triggers the creation of a new task when clicked.
    - Capture the entered data from the form and validate it on the server-side.
    - Store the task details in the database, associating them with the user who created the task.

# Step 3: Task Assignment:

1. Provide a dropdown or search functionality to select users or teams to assign tasks:
    
    - Design a dropdown menu or search field that allows users to select or search for other users or teams within the system.
    - Implement an autocomplete or filtering mechanism to assist users in finding the desired users or teams.
2. Display the assigned users or teams alongside the task details:
    
    - Update the UI to show the assigned users or teams associated with each task.
    - Implement functionality to save the assignment details in the database, linking the assigned users or teams to the respective task.

# Step 4: Task Tracking:

1. Show a list of tasks with their corresponding status and progress indicators:
    
    - Create a task list view that displays the tasks, including their titles, descriptions, due dates, and status indicators.
    - Implement filtering or sorting options to help users organize and find tasks based on criteria like due date or status.
2. Include options to update the task status, mark tasks as completed, or set the percentage completion:
    
    - Add buttons or dropdown menus within each task item to allow users to update the task status (e.g., in progress, completed).
    - Implement functionality to mark tasks as completed or update the percentage completion as users make progress on their tasks.

# Step 5: Notifications:

1. Design a notification center or dashboard to display task-related notifications:
    
    - Create a dedicated UI component to show notifications related to task assignments, updates, or approaching deadlines.
    - Design the UI to display notifications in a clear and organized manner, indicating the task and relevant details.
2. Include options to view and manage notifications:
    
    - Implement functionality to allow users to view all their notifications in a list or grouped by category.
    - Provide options to mark notifications as read, delete them, or perform other relevant actions.

# Step 6: Reporting:

1. Create a dashboard or analytics page that showcases task-related metrics and charts:
    
    - Design a dashboard UI that displays key metrics and charts related to task management, such as completed tasks per day, tasks by priority, or task completion rates.
    - Use appropriate charting libraries or frameworks to visualize the data in an informative and user-friendly way.
2. Include filters and options for generating customized reports based on different criteria (e.g., task status, time period):
    
    - Add filter options to allow users to customize the generated reports based on criteria like task status, time period, or assigned users.
    - Implement functionality to fetch and process the relevant data from the database and generate the reports dynamically.
